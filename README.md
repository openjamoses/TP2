# TP2

This is a simple d3 project,
please don't take it serous, it was just for fun,
but of course may give u the basic idea if u are also a beginner in d3 like me,

Lets have fun!!!!!!
1) - Clone the project using normal git command
  git clone https://github.com/openjamoses/TP2.git
2) - Although this is just a bunch of html and javascript, I suggest running the code by configuring ur local server,
--- Anyway thats node even a big issue, you can still configure your browser to accept local file.

The code is actually simple to understand, simply open the project using your most favourite editor, (For us in this task i used atom -:)-:)-:)..... :) please don't mind us!! )

You may modifier any of the files but we recomend starting with the simple files like preproc.js, line-chart, ... before going bigger.. also don't mind us here, u can own the project :)

What else do you need? find us at Polytechnique Montreal, for special deal..
