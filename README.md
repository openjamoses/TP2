# TP2
This is a simple d3 project,
please don't take it seriously, it was just for fun,
but of course, may give you the basic idea if you are also a beginner in d3 like me,

Let's have fun!!!!!!
 - Clone the project using standard git command:
  git clone https://github.com/openjamoses/TP2.git
 - Although this is just a bunch of HTML and javascript, I suggest running the code by configuring your local server,
--- Anyway, that's not a big issue, you can still configure your browser to accept the local file.

The code is simple to understand, open the project using your most favorite editor, (For us in this task we used atom -:)-:)-:)- :) please don't mind us!! )

You may modify any of the files, but we recommend starting with the simple files like preproc.js, line-chart,  before going bigger. Don't mind us here; you can own the project :)

What else do you need? Find us at Polytechnique Montreal for the special deal.
